# hello-world

Hi Humans!

I am a Research Masters student at HKUST in the beautiful and hustling Hong Kong. I did my undergraduate studies in Electronics & Computer Engineering at HKUST also. My research involved imaging, hardware configuration, machine learning, statistical signal processing and optimization.

Most of the time, I enjoy programming, doing research and writing code that is requested by my research advisor.

In my spare time, I love playing tennis and watching films.
